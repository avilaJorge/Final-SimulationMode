## Final Project (Simulation Mode) for Math173 in Fall 2014

#### These are the instructions Professor Arenas provided:

#### Exam Part 2: The Simulation Tool

======

In this portion of the exam you will write a program that will start with a random housing
configuration and move around pieces in an effort to make everyone content. You may
model this portion after “Simulation mode.exe”.

The program should work like exploration tool except the user can not interact with the
generated map via the mouse. Rather, when the user presses ‘s’ a simulation should
start. This simulation randomly selects unhappy residents and moves them into random
empty spots. Keep in mind that by moving the resident in question you may make others 3 unhappy. The program may run forever depending on the level of bias. The segregation
should be reported in real-time.

The naive code for this is straightforward, but your program will run very slow, especially
as it nears completion.

Extra credit: Get your code to run as fast as my example for bias levels less than 70%.
